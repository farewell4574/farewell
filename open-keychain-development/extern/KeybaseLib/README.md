KeybaseLib
=========

General-purpose Java-language library for keybase.io clients

At the moment, this is set up as an Android shared library project with Android Studio apparatus, 
because it was motivated by adding Keybase search to OpenKeychain.  But it should work as a pure
vanilla Java library.
